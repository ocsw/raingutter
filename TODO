handle non-unique field titles, fc labels, relations
    probably need to have selects pass IDs, deltas back
    for labels, will need to select by delta in the getter
    for updates, probably need to limit by delta and/or prev. value

separate transform and to_x functions?  compare vs store...

update timestamp on previous node when updating n->r->n?

remove cursors?

generic_db_insert

deletes, e.g. if source is NULL and dest isn't
