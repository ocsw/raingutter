remove cursors?

no_replicate (SET sql_log_bin=0/1; but - check/store)

generic_db_insert

deletes, e.g. if source is NULL and dest isn't

handle non-unique field titles, fc labels, relations
    probably need to have selects pass IDs, deltas back
    for labels, will need to select by delta in the getter
    for updates, probably need to limit by delta and/or prev. value
    -> NFS/SMB

separate transform and to_x functions?  compare vs store...

handle interpreting drupal field defaults

check min/max, other constraints when adding fields (including defaults)

docstring / USAGE / mod notes re chains, phpserialize
more examples/sql, esp for drupal?

error handling: exit/skip?

autocommit options

node -> title, fc -> label, etc. (?)
